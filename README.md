### Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** + React 19 (App Router, Server Components)
- **Leaflet** + CARTO Voyager tiles (free, no API key)
- **Prisma** + SQLite (zero-config local DB)
- **TypeScript** end-to-end

## API

### `GET /api/events`

Query events by building and time window.

| Param | Type | Default |
|-------|------|---------|
| `buildingId` | CUID | — |
| `from` | ISO date | now |
| `to` | ISO date | now + 3 days |
| `category` | string | — |

### `GET /api/buildings`

Returns all buildings with coordinates and campus info.
